## Introduction

A GPU Ray-marching solution for 2D shadow casting in Unity.

## Disclaimer

This project is made for practice purposes, please do not use this for any actual game development.

The older version of this project had a serious bug, so I spent some time cleaning those up, and here it is.

## How to use?

1. Put "ShadowCaster2DCamera" on your rendering camera
2. Put "ShadowCaster2DGPU" on an empty GameObject
3. Remember to adjust their relative depth!
