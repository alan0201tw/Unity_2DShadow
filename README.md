## Introduction

Several simple 2D shadow caster implemented with different algorithms.

1. CPU Ray-casting approach : 
   * base on the algorithm provided in Sebastian Lague's Field of view visualisation tutorial, which can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQG9aUWarwE).
   * The shadow computations are done by CPU. I think this is easier to make interactions between other objects and shadow casters.

2. GPU Ray-marching approach :
   * (Notes to be added)
